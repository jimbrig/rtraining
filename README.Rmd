## Installation
<!-- install: start -->

You can install the released version of rtraining from 
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("rtraining")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jimbrig/rtraining")
```

***

The list of dependencies required to install this package is: attachment, chameleon, devtools, knitr, pkgdown, rmarkdown, roxygen2, utils, xfun.

To install the package, you can run the following script

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_local(path = "rtraining_0.0.1.tar.gz")
```

In case something went wrong, you may want to install dependencies before using:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Remotes ----
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github('ThinkR-open/chameleon')
# Attachments ----
to_install <- c("xfun")
  for (i in to_install) {
    message(paste("looking for ", i))
    if (!requireNamespace(i)) {
      message(paste("     installing", i))
      install.packages(i)
    }
  }
```

Once you have the package installed you can open the website directly by running:

```{r run_pkgdown, eval=FALSE}
library(rtraining)
rtraining::open_pkgdown()
```


Similarly you can open the package `bookdown` with:

```{r open_guide, eval=FALSE}
rtraining::open_guide()
```
