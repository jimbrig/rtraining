## Getting Started with R and Shiny

Below is a collection of resources for getting started in R and Shiny.

They are listed roughly in the order that I would expect a motivated beginner to work through them.

### Getting Stated with R

* Download R here: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* Download the free version of Rstudio here: [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
* Getting Started with R: [https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/)
* R4DS: [https://r4ds.had.co.nz/](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
  * note: I recommend skimming through the above book and trying out examples. 

    Skip over sections that you do not understand, and you can come back to them

    later.

_For a more in-depth walkthrough of setting up R see the_ [_R Setup Guide_](https://jimbrig.github.io/rtraining/articles/setting-up-r.html) _vignette_

### Getting Started with GitHub

* Create a GitHub account: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) . You may need to install git first from here: [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* If you are not familiar with git, this article gives a nice overview: [https://jahya.net/blog/git-vs-github/](https://jahya.net/blog/git-vs-github/)
* Try out example 1 from this tutorial: [https://github.com/bcgov/bcgov-data-science-resources/wiki/Tutorial:-Intro-to-Git-&-GitHub-for-the-R-User](https://github.com/bcgov/bcgov-data-science-resources/wiki/Tutorial:-Intro-to-Git-&-GitHub-for-the-R-User)

### Getting Started with Shiny

What is Shiny from Rstudio:

> Shiny is an open source R package that provides an elegant and powerful web framework for building web applications using R. Shiny helps you turn your analyses into interactive web applications without requiring HTML, CSS, or JavaScript knowledge.

Built in tutorials for packages can be accessed through the learnr package. For example if you library learnr and tidyverse, the top right panel of RStudio can display a walk through of different functions in the tidyverse package.
