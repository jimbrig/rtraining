1. R Setup and Configuration: a thorough walkthrough for setting up and 
configuring R, RStudio, and various other software in an efficient manner.

2. R Workflows: example workflows showcasing the main types of work done with R,
including, but not limited to R Data Analysis Projects, Reporting with RMarkdown,
R Shiny Applications, R Package Development.
  
3. R Tips & Tricks: General tips and tricks learned over time from my experiences
with R.
